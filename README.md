# Shopping Cart

More Node, Express and MongoDB practice, this time with user management and building a shopping cart for e-commerce.

## Branch user-management

The user-management branch is saved as reference for a simple user management setup. Registering an account, loggin in and out, storing sessions, validation, etc.

* Mongoose for handeling MongoDB.
* Connect-mongo for storing sessions in db rather than in memory.
* Passport and passport-local for authentication.
* validator for comparing fields.
* bcrypt-nodejs for encrypting passwords.
* flash for setting messages.
